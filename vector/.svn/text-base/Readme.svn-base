A Class for Cartesian 3-vectors.

Vectors can have usual vector arithmetic applied: addition (+), scalar multiplication (*), 
inner (dot)-product (*), outer (cross)-product (^), normalisation etc. Also rotated. 

See Cartesian3Vector.h for the possibilities. Note ^ and * are used for cross and dot 
respectively to give the correct precedance.

Placements: useful for dealing with positions and orientations of bodies in 3D. They containg a 
3-vector for the position, and two 3-vectors for orientation: inplane, which is the direction 
cosines of some vector in the plane of the body, and normal, which must be normal to inplane. 
It is up to the user to choose just what he means by htese vectors.

Note that a body needs only 6 parameters to define its position and orientation. Placements have 
9, but two are not free because the direction cosine vectors have unit length; and one more is 
fixed by the requirement that the two direction-cosine vectors are perpendicular.
