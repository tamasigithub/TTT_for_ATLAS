The package GmxLayouts collects together the xml input files (also known as .gmx files) for layouts
described with GeoModelXml.

Structure:

trunk/data/ITk/Strip: For all Strip layouts for the future ITk system (LoI, 4 layers, ...)
               Pixel: For pixel layouts, currently a geometry from Joakim gradin
               Beampipe: If anyone wants to put it in GeoModelXml

Each subdirectory of these contains a set of .gmx files making up the description, e.g.:
trunk/data/ITk/Strip/LoI for the LoI strip layout.

The geomodel.dtd file is part of the GeoModelXml package, and should be obtained from there.

The LTF Strip layout contains two bash scripts that may be useful elsewhere:

check: uses xmllint to check your .gmx files. Very much quicker than trying to start VP1 only to find a simple error.

makeblob: combines all .gmx files into one, with the intention to upload this into the geometry database.
